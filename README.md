This was primarily a project to test the extents of chatGPT's ability to code. The majority of the code (besides specific text outputs) was generated by chatGPT. 

ChatGPT is robust in its ability to produce code, but there were quite a few errors that required manual debugging. Even with some prompting, chatGPT could not determine the source of the error beyond broad categories of what could cause the issue. Some of the stylistic choices in the code are also quite poor, resulting in code that is less elegant than something a person might write.
